##  The SPI speed (in hz) to use when communicating with the chip.

## Output data rate for ADXL345. ADXL345 supports the following data
##  rates: 3200, 1600, 800, 400, 200, 100, 50, and 25. Note that it is
## not recommended to change this rate from the default 3200, and
##  rates below 800 will considerably affect the quality of resonance
##  measurements.
#rate: 3200
##  The accelerometer axis for each of the printer's x, y, and z axes.
##  This may be useful if the accelerometer is mounted in an
##  orientation that does not match the printer orientation. For
##  example, one could set this to "y,x,z" to swap the x and y axes.
##  It is also possible to negate an axis if the accelerometer
##  direction is reversed (eg, "x,z,-y"). The default is "x,y,z".

##  Maximum input shaper smoothing to allow for each axis during shaper
##  auto-calibration (with 'SHAPER_CALIBRATE' command). By default no
##  maximum smoothing is specified. Refer to Measuring_Resonances guide
##  for more details on using this feature.
#max_smoothing:
##  Minimum/Maximum frequency to test for resonances.
#min_freq: 5
#max_freq: 133
##  This parameter is used to determine which acceleration to use to
##  test a specific frequency: accel = accel_per_hz * freq. Higher the
##  value, the higher is the energy of the oscillations. Can be set to
##  a lower than the default value if the resonances get too strong on
##  the printer. However, lower values make measurements of
##  high-frequency resonances less precise. The default value is 75
##  (mm/sec).
#accel_per_hz: 75
##  Determines the speed of the test. When testing all frequencies in
##  range [min_freq, max_freq], each second the frequency increases by
##  hz_per_sec. Small values make the test slow, and the large values
##  will decrease the precision of the test. The default value is 1.0
##  (Hz/sec == sec^-2).
